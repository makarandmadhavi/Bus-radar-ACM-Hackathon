# Bus-radar-ACM-Hackathon

Commuting by Buses in Mumbai is one of the most unreliable mode of public transportations. The government agencies that provide public services in Mumbai metropolitan region i.e. BEST, NMMT, TMT, KDMT, MBMT, VVMT provide no fixed time table of operation of their services. For the agencies that do, Buses are never on time. They either arrive and leave at a Bus stop too early or are late and delayed due to traffic and other reasons. Many a times these Buses get overcrowded and if one has to opt not to board a Bus due to it being overcrowded, there is no guarantee of when the next Bus; to the destination he wishes to go will arrive or will it be overcrowded like the last one. 
For the general public, an app that tracks and displays the location of all Buses arriving and leaving any Bus stop on the map. For a particular Bus along with Bus number it will show details like destination, the route of the Bus, expected time of arrival at a stop etc.
The aim of the system is to provide feedback on reliable data to users about buses.
